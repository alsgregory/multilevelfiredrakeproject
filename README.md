Software applying the Multilevel Monte Carlo method to a wide range of high dimensional problems using Firedrake

- Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) was developed by Giles in 2006. Since then a wide range of computational statistics applications of it have been designed. 
- This software builds generalised code where high dimensional systems of equations, temporally and spatially discretized via Firedrake (http://www.firedrakeproject.org/index.html), can have the MLMC method applied to them for uses in uncertainty quantification, ensemble forecasting, importance sampling and even data assimilation.
